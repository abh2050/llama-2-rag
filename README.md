# README: RAG with LLaMa 13B Notebook

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the integration and utilization of the open-source Llama-13b-chat model in Hugging Face transformers and LangChain. The focus is on showcasing the capabilities of the LLaMa 13B model for text generation, particularly within the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework.

### Prerequisites
- Request access to Llama 2 models via the provided form.
- Run this notebook in an environment with GPU support, such as Google Colab, for efficient processing.

## Installation
Install all required libraries:

```bash
!pip install -qU \
  transformers==4.31.0 \
  sentence-transformers==2.2.2 \
  pinecone-client==2.2.2 \
  datasets==2.14.0 \
  accelerate==0.21.0 \
  einops==0.6.1 \
  langchain==0.0.240 \
  xformers==0.0.20 \
  bitsandbytes==0.41.0
```

## Initialization
### Hugging Face Embedding Pipeline
- Initialize the embedding pipeline using `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- Configure to run on a GPU if available.

### Pinecone Vector Index
- Initialize the Pinecone vector index using a Pinecone API key.
- Create and connect to the index for storing document embeddings.

### Dataset
- Load and preprocess a dataset of Arxiv papers related to Llama 2 for embedding and indexing.

## Model Setup
### Hugging Face Text-Generation Pipeline
- Initialize `meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf` using Hugging Face transformers.
- Configure model quantization for efficient memory usage.
- Authenticate with Hugging Face using an API token.

### LangChain Integration
- Implement the LLaMa 13B model in LangChain using `HuggingFacePipeline`.
- Test the model's text generation capabilities.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Combine the LLaMa 13B model and Pinecone vector store to create a RAG pipeline.
- Test the RAG pipeline with various queries and compare the results with the standalone LLaMa 13B model.

## Usage Examples
- Detailed examples of using the standalone model vs. the RAG pipeline for text generation tasks.
- Insights into the performance of LLaMa 13B in comparison to other large language models.

## Conclusion
- The notebook concludes with a demonstration of the enhanced capabilities of the RAG pipeline in comparison to the standalone model.
